Our code is vastly different in terms of subject matter compared to what we submitted to College Board, but most of the code is the same. We did add an array to compare correct answers to user answers and tell the user which answers they got wrong, but besides that, the point value addition and such are the same as what was submitted to College Board. We had to make these changes in order to fit the requirements (have a function that is called multiple times and a separate collection).
 
Our program is a true or false question quiz. The user is prompted for their name and is then presented with 10 true or false questions. For each question, the user responds with either “t” or “f” which are characters that represent true or false. The program then stores the user's answers in an array, useranswer, and compares them to the correct answers, stored in the array coranswer. Each question is assigned a true or false value with the boolean trueq, which is given to the function getscore and used to give the user a point if their question is correct. After the user answers all the questions, the program calculates the percent of correct answers and presents it to the user. Then, the user is presented with a message that tells them the number of questions and which questions they got incorrect.
